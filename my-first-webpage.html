        <p>My goal is to be a software engineer, <strong>primarily</strong> in the <em>health care</em> sector.</p>
        <p>I have alot of ideas that I simply want to test out, and that I think can add some real  <a href="https://cbirt.org/"><strong> value </strong></a> to peoples lives .</p>
        <p> I think there is alot of potential <strong>specifically in the mental health arena. </strong> </p>
