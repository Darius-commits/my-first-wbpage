            <h1>My favorite places</h1>
            <h2>These are places I actually like to visit</h2>

            <p>The places I like to visit are simple places. I have a personal philosophy that says we can all be the best versions of ourselves. I think all things exsist at the same time so life ends up being the amalgamation of what you actually gave energy to.
               Even before we get to the action phase of our reality (what we percieve as reality), there is another realm or dimension where creation takes place. I liken it to the affect of myelin production. You give a habit or action more and more traction, soon
               you have this incredibly dense insulation around it. You can't even take it away you can only build around it or have another habit take it's place. What im saying is, What you put in, is what you get out.
